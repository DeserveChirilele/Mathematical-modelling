First things, I loaded dataset into python to perform EDA. I got basic information about the dataset. I checked the number of duplicate values if they are present in the data. I found the number of unique values in the particular column using unique() function in python.
I visualized the unique values present in the data. For this, I used the seaborn library. I called the sns.countlot() function and specified the variable to plot the count plot. I also find null values and datatypes. Next, I filered the data and created box plots for numerical columnes using a single line of code. Furthermore, I found the correlation among the variables, that I could make use of the correlation function. This gave me a fair idea of the correlation strength between different variables. Last but not least, I visualized the correlation matrix using seaborn library. For the conclusion, education's level affect the final weight.

# Problems
I am new to python. When I used Jupyter Notebook the code inside the cells wasn’t executed and I got these empty brackets ([ ]).
 I also found problem to search for suitable platform or software to write the coding. 
I tried Python and Online's Jupiter Notebook, but it didn't go through really well until I use Jupiter Notebook in Anaconda then I start to write coding smoothly. I also realized there are a lot of different way to write coding, which confused me in the beginning.


#ЛР-2
From Lab.1 Generally, our measurements and model scores worked well to show the aim of the study. This study can be completed in a shorter way as well without repeating similar functions; however, this study also aims to use different methods to have accurate scores from variable sources. I used the following algorithms:

Random forest classifier 
Logistics regression 

Conclusion: I didn’t manage get the best  fit modal for our dataset because the algorithm got stuck at the it took like 30 minutes calculating
